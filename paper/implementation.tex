\section{Implementation}\label{implementation}
At \url{https://github.com/google/hctr2}
we provide a (very slow) reference implementation of HCTR2 in Python,
a portable C implementation,
and assembly implementations for x86-64 and ARM64
making use of AES acceleration and carryless multiplication instructions.
We adapted our assembly implementation of XCTR mode from
the Linux kernel's CTR mode implementation, retaining all parallelism.

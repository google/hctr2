When the underlying block cipher is secure in the sense of a strong pseudorandom permutation (PRP), our scheme is secure in the sense of tweakable, strong PRP. Such an object can be used to encipher the sectors of a disk, in-place, offering security as good as can be obtained in this setting. CMC makes a pass of CBC encryption, xors in a mask, and then makes a pass of CBC decryption; no universal hashing, nor any other non-trivial operation beyond the block-cipher calls, is employed. Besides proving the security of CMC we initiate a more general investigation of tweakable enciphering schemes, considering issues like the non-malleability of these objects."

The mode is parallelizable, but as serial-efficient as the non-parallelizable mode CMC [6]. EME can be used to solve the disk-sector encryption problem. The algorithm entails two layers of ECB encryption and a ``lightweight mixing'' in between. We prove EME secure, in the reduction-based sense of modern cryptography. We motivate some of the design choices in EME by showing that a few simple modifications of this mode are insecure."

PEP uses a hash-encrypt-hash approach which has been recently used in the construction of HCTR. This approach is different from the encrypt-mask-encrypt approach of constructions such as CMC, EME and EME*. The general hash-encrypt-hash approach was earlier used by Naor-Reingold to provide a generic construction technique for an SPRP (but not a tweakable SPRP). PEP can be seen as the development of the Naor-Reingold approach into a fully specified mode of operation with a concrete security reduction for a tweakable strong pseudo-random permutation. HCTR is also based on the Naor-Reingold approach but its security bound is weaker than PEP. Compared to previous known constructions, PEP is the only known construction of tweakable SPRP which uses a single key, is efficiently parallelizable and can handle an arbitrary number of blocks."

At Crypto 2007, Halevi presented constructions of invertible block-wise universal hash functions and a new mode of operation (called TET) based on them. In this paper, we present a new mode of operation called HEH using the Naor-Reingold approach. This is built using a new construction of invertible block-wise universal hash function. The new construction improves over Halevi's construction by removing restrictions on the hashing key. This in turn, leads to HEH improving over TET by allowing more efficient encryption and decryption of variable length messages as well as supporting better key agility. For the important application of disk encryption, we present a variant called HEHfp which has better key agility than TET."

In this paper, we provide a proof of security for XCB, and show that it is a secure tweakable (super) pseudorandom permutation. Our analysis makes several new contributions: it uses an algebraic property of XCB's internal universal hash function to simplify the proof, and it defines a nonce mode in which XCB can be securely used even when the plaintext is shorter than twice the width of the underlying block cipher. We also show minor modifications that improve the performance of XCB and make it easier to analyze. XCB is interesting because it is highly efficient in both hardware and software, it has no alignment restrictions on input lengths, it can be used in nonce mode, and it uses the internal functions of the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) of operation, which facilitates design re-use and admits multi-purpose implementations."

We prove that HCTR is a strong tweakable pseudorandom permutation (                                                                           {\$}{\backslash}widetilde{\{}sprp{\}}{\$}                ), when the underlying blockcipher is a strong pseudorandom permutation (sprp). HCTR is shown to be a very efficient mode of operation when some pre-computations are taken into consideration. Arbitrary variable input length brings much flexibility in various application environments. HCTR can be used in disk sector encryption, and other length-preserving encryptions, especially for the message that is not multiple of n bits."

Our VIL mode of operation makes a variable-input-length cipher from any block cipher. The method is demonstrably secure in the provable-security sense of modern cryptography: we give a quantitative security analysis relating the difficulty of breaking the constructed (variable-input-length) cipher to the difficulty of breaking the underlying block cipher."

Such a cipher has not only the usual inputs --- message and cryptographic key --- but also a third input, the ``tweak.'' The tweak serves much the same purpose that an initialization vector does for CBC mode or that a nonce does for OCB mode. Our proposal thus brings this feature down to the primitive block-cipher level, instead of incorporating it only at the higher modes-of-operation levels. We suggest that (1) tweakable block ciphers are easy to design, (2) the extra cost of making a block cipher ``tweakable'' is small, and (3) it is easier to design and prove modes of operation based on tweakable block ciphers."

The method is based on composing four (or three for weakened security) so-called Feistel permutations, each of which requires the evaluation of a pseudorandom function. We reduce somewhat the complexity of the construction and simplify its proof of security by showing that two Feistel permutations are sufficient together with initial and final pairwise independent permutations. The revised construction and proof provide a framework in which similar constructions may be brought up and their security can be easily proved. We demonstrate this by presenting some additional adjustments of the construction that achieve the following:"

Salsa20 has progressed to the third round of eSTREAM without any changes. The 20-round stream cipher Salsa20/20 is consistently faster than AES and is recommended by the designer for typical cryptographic applications. The reduced-round ciphers Salsa20/12 and Salsa20/8 are among the fastest 256-bit stream ciphers available and are recommended for applications where speed is more important than confidence. The fastest known attacks use ≈{\thinspace}2153 simple operations against Salsa20/7, ≈{\thinspace}2249 simple operations against Salsa20/8, and ≈{\thinspace}2255 simple operations against Salsa20/9, Salsa20/10, etc. In this paper, the Salsa20 designer presents Salsa20 and discusses the decisions made in the Salsa20 design."

Though HCTR is quite an efficient mode, the authors showed a cubic security bound for HCTR which makes it unsuitable for applications where tweakable strong pseudorandom permutations are required. In this paper we show that HCTR has a better security bound than what the authors showed. We prove that the distinguishing advantage of an adversary in distinguishing HCTR and its inverse from a random permutation and its inverse is bounded above by $4.5\sigma^2/2^n$, where n is the block-length of the block-cipher and $\sigma$ is the number of n-block queries made by the adversary (including the tweak).}

Here we introduce a new notion of security, KDM security, appropriate for key-dependent messages. The notion makes sense in both the publickey and shared-key settings. For the latter we show that KDM security is easily achievable within the random-oracle model. By developing and achieving stronger notions of encryption-scheme security it is hoped that protocols which are proven secure under ``formal'' models of security can, in time, be safely realized by generically instantiating their primitives."

To achieve such speeds, UMAC uses a new universal hash-function family, NH, and a design which allows effective exploitation of SIMD parallelism. The ``cryptographic'' work of UMAC is done using standard primitives of the user's choice, such as a block cipher or cryptographic hash function; no new heuristic primitives are developed here. Instead, the security of UMAC is rigorously proven, in the sense of giving exact and quantitatively strong results which demonstrate an inability to forge UMAC-authenticated messages assuming an inability to break the underlying cryptographic primitive. Unlike conventional, inherently serial MACs, UMAC is parallelizable, and will have ever-faster implementation speeds as machines offer up increasing amounts of parallelism. We envision UMAC as a practical algorithm for next-generation message authentication."

For t{\thinspace}={\thinspace}1, Even and Mansour proved indistinguishability security up to 2n/2 queries, which is tight. Much later Bogdanov et al.

The most significant effort to analyse Salsa and ChaCha was explained by Aumasson et al. long back (FSE 2008) and further, only minor improvements could be achieved. In this paper, first we revisit the work of Aumasson et al. to provide a clearer insight of the existing attack (2248 complexity for ChaCha7, i.e., 7 rounds) and show certain improvements (complexity around 2243) by exploiting additional Probabilistic Neutral Bits. More importantly, we describe a novel idea that explores proper choice of IVs corresponding to the keys, for which the complexity can be improved further (2239). The choice of IVs corresponding to the keys is the prime observation of this work. We systematically show how a single difference propagates after one round and how the differences can be reduced with proper choices of IVs. For Salsa too (Salsa20/8, i.e., 8 rounds), we get improvement in complexity, reducing it to 2245.5 from 2247.2 reported by Aumasson et al."

ChaCha is a variant of Salsa20 aiming at bringing better diffusion for similar performance. Variants of Salsa20 with up to 7 rounds (instead of 20) have been broken by differential cryptanalysis, while ChaCha has not been analyzed yet. We introduce a novel method for differential cryptanalysis of Salsa20 and ChaCha, inspired by correlation attacks and related to the notion of neutral bits. This is the first application of neutral bits in stream cipher cryptanalysis. It allows us to break the 256-bit version of Salsa20/8, to bring faster attacks on the 7-round variant, and to break 6- and 7-round ChaCha. In a second part, we analyze the compression function Rumba, built as the XOR of four Salsa20 instances and returning a 512-bit output. We find collision and preimage attacks for two simplified variants, then we discuss differential attacks on the original version, and exploit a high-probability differential to reduce complexity of collision search from 2256 to 279 for 3-round Rumba. To prove the correctness of our approach we provide examples of collisions and near-collisions on simplified versions."

EU ECRYPT network has organized a project for identifying new stream suitable for widespread adoption where the ciphers can provide a more security levels. Finally the result of the project has identified new stream ciphers referred as eSTREAM. Salsa20 is one of the eSTREAM cipher built on a pseudorandom function. In this paper our contribution is two phases. First phase have two parts. In WCC 2015, Maitra et al. [9] explained characterization of valid states by reversing one round of Salsa20.

We found there is a mistake in one bit change in {\$}{\$}8^{\{}th{\}}{\$}{\$}and {\$}{\$}9^{\{}th{\}}{\$}{\$}word in first round will result in valid initial state. In second part, Maitra et al. [9] as mentioned that it would be an interesting combinatorial problem to characterize all such states. We have characterized nine more values which lead to valid initial states.

We constructed a distinguisher of double-bit differentials to improve Aumasson's single-bit differential cryptanalysis. We searched for correlations using a PC, and found strong correlations in 9-round Salsa20 and 8-round ChaCha. The complexities of the introduced attacks are 216 in 9-round Salsa20 and 2 in 8-round ChaCha, which are much less than the complexities of an exhaustive key search and existing attacks on those ciphers. The results show that an adversary can distinguish keystream bits from random bits using a few input and output pairs of an initial keys and initial vectors. This method has potential to apply to a wide range of stream ciphers; a double-bit correlation would be found in case that no single-bit correlation is found."

The most significant step in the cryptanalysis of Salsa and ChaCha is the idea of Probabilistic Neutral Bits, which was introduced by Aumasson et al. (FSE 2008). After that, no significant improvement is achieved in the procedure of choosing Probabilistic Neutral Bits. The works in this direction mostly were concerned about forward probabilities. In this paper, we give a new algorithm to construct Probabilistic Neutral Bits. We use this algorithm to improve the existing attacks for reduced rounds of both Salsa and ChaCha. Our attacks on Salsa and Chacha are respectively around 2.27 and 5.39 times faster than the existing works of Choudhuri and Maitra (accepted in FSE 2017)."

Besides, we exhibit new high probability second-order differential trails not covered by the previous methods, generalize the notion of PNB to probabilistic neutral vectors (PNV) and show that the set of PNV is no smaller than that of PNB.

We provide a security proof of a structure that underlies HCTR and HCH. We prove that the expansion can be instantiated with any function secure against Known-plaintext attacks (KPAs), which is called a weak pseudorandom function (WPRF). As an application of our proof, we provide efficient blockcipher-based schemes comparable to HCH and HCTR. For the double-block-length case, our result is an interesting extension of previous attempts to build a double-block-length cryptographic permutation using WPRF."

Our favorite construction, XCBC, works like this: if |M| is a positive multiple of n then XOR the n-bit key K2 with the last block of M and compute the CBC MAC keyed with K1; otherwise, extend M's length to the next multiple of n by appending minimal 10i padding (i ≥ 0), XOR the n-bit key K3 with the last block of the padded message, and compute the CBC MAC keyed with K1. We prove the security of this and other constructions, giving concrete bounds on an adversary's inability to forge in terms of her inability to distinguish the block cipher from a random permutation.

,   abstractNote={Universal hash functions based on univariate polynomials are well known, e.g. Poly1305 and GHASH. Using Horner’s rule to evaluate such hash functionsrequire &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;l&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; − 1 field multiplications for hashing a message consisting of &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;l&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; blocks where each block is one field element. A faster method is based on the class of Bernstein-Rabin-Winograd (BRW) polynomials which require ⌊&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;l&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;/2⌋ multiplications and ⌊lg&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;l&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;⌋ squarings for &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;l&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;≥3 blocks. Though this is significantly smaller than Horner’s rule based hashing, implementation of BRW polynomials for variable length messages present significant difficulties. In this work, we propose a two-level hash function where BRW polynomial based hashing is done at the lower level and Horner’s rule based hashing is done at the higher level. The BRW polynomial based hashing is applied to a fixed number of blocks and hence the difficulties in handling variable length messages is avoided. Even though the hash function has two levels, we show that it is sufficient to use a single field element as the hash key. The basic idea is instantiated to propose two new hash functions, one which hashes a single binary string and the other can hash a vector of binary strings. We describe two actual implementations, one over F&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;128&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; and the other over F&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;256&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; both using the pclmulqdq instruction available in modern Intel processors. On both the Haswell and Skylake processors, the implementation over F&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;128&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; is faster than both an implementation of GHASH by Gueron; and a highly optimised implementation, also by Gueron, of another polynomial based hash function called POLYVAL. We further show that the Fast Fourier Transform based field multiplication over F&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;256&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; proposed by Bernstein and Chou can be used to evaluate the new hash function at a cost of about at most 46 bit operations per bit of digest, but, unlike the Bernstein-Chou analysis, there is no hidden cost of generating the hash key. More generally, the new idea of building a two-level hash function having a single field element as the hash key can be applied to other finite fields to build new hash functions.}

For disk encryption, the results from the implementations show that ${\sf {FAST}}$ compares very favourably to the IEEE disk encryption standards XCB and EME2 as well as the more recent proposal AEZ. ${\sf {FAST}}$ is built using a fixed input length pseudo-random function and an appropriate hash function. It uses a single-block key, is parallelisable and can be instantiated using only the encryption function of a block cipher. The hash function can be instantiated using either the Horner's rule based usual polynomial hashing or hashing based on the more efficient Bernstein-Rabin-Winograd polynomials. Security of ${\sf {FAST}}$ has been rigorously analysed using the standard provable security approach and concrete security bounds have been derived. Based on our implementation results, we put forward ${\sf {FAST}}$ as a serious candidate for standardisation and deployment."

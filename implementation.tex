\section{Implementation}\label{implementation}
We provide generic implementations of HCTR2 in Python and C, as well as hardware accelerated implementations for x86-64 and ARM64. The implementation is available at {\color{red} FIXME}. The rest of this section describes the optimizations used to efficiently implement HCTR2, as well as speed comparisons with other algorithms. This section is intended to document all of the design decisions made when implementing HCTR2 in assembly.

Optimization of POLYVAL is a subject of independent
interest, which we defer to \autoref{polyvalimpl}.

\subsection{XCTR mode}
Since the only difference between traditional CTR mode and XCTR is the counter, a slight modification to an accelerated CTR implementation yields an accelerated XCTR implementation. Our hardware accelerated XCTR implementation was adapted from the Linux kernel's implementation of CTR mode. The implementation retains all of its parallelism after modification. 

\subsection{Speed comparisons}
{\color{red} FIXME Tables, grahps, etc}
